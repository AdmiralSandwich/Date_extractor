This code extracts date from a given image(any kind of bill) using goolge-vision(date_extract.py) . 
The code in thie repo is used to test against the given dataset of images . 
Please make sure that the image is in the current directory and also also the google credential file has not been included in this , you need to make your own google vision credential file since sharing credential fine is not advised.
There is a image file that shows the accuracy of my code in a given data set of 595 images, im getting around 86% accuracy. 
I was not able to create a rest api from it but ive added the code(rest_api_date_extractor.py).
